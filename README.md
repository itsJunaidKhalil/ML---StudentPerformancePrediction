# ML - StudentPerformancePrediction
This machine learning project focuses on predicting the factors influencing student grades using classifiers and data from a CSV file.

The dataset comprises students from various nationalities and grade levels, along with determining factors such as the number of hands raised, attendance records, hours of study, etc., stored in a CSV file.

Several classifiers and machine learning models are employed to achieve accurate predictions regarding the factors impacting student marks.

To enhance understanding and visualize the results, graphical representations including graphs and confusion matrices are generated. These aids help illustrate the outcomes and the efficacy of the different classifiers and models used.
